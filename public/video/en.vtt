00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.550
Skin color reflects the intensity of sunlight in which our ancestors lived.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.787
If our ancestors lived under conditions of very intense year round sunlight,

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.283
then, they will have more protective dark pigmentation, and darker skin.

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.652
If they lived more toward the poles, under conditions of far more seasonal and weaker sunlight,

5
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.892
skin pigmentation will be less intense, more sun can actually penetrate into the skin, and the skin is lighter in color.

6
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.996
What we see is a gradient from dark to light based on the intensity of the sun.
